Based on CUDA, Uni-Dock achieved more than 1600 times acceleration on GPU compared to CPU and saved five times the cost without losing accuracy. Integrated into advanced industrial Computer-aided drug design (CADD) product, Uni-Dock enables ultra-large virtual screening of early-stage drug discovery in hours, used by hundreds of chemists.
